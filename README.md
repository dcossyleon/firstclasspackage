firstclass
==========

The goal of firstclass is to practice putting the following in a package:

1.  A raw data file
2.  A couple of homemade functions
3.  A learnR tutorial .Rmd file
4.  A template .Rmd file

This demonstrates that packages are a useful way for educators to deliver their materials and teaching content to students.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of firstclass from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("firstclass")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("dcossyleon/firstclasspackage")
```

Example
-------

Here is where I will include some examples of what you can do with this package:

``` r
library(firstclass)
## basic example code
```
